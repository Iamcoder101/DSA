Here’s a prioritized roadmap you can follow to make the most of your campus placement preparation. This roadmap includes all the essential topics and skills, with a focus on building a strong foundation first and then expanding your expertise based on your target companies and roles.

Priority 1: Core Technical Skills
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Why first: DSA is the cornerstone of most technical interviews, especially for top product-based companies.
Focus Areas:
Arrays, Strings
Linked Lists
Stacks, Queues
Trees, Binary Search Trees, Heaps
Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
Dynamic Programming (DP)
Greedy Algorithms
Recursion & Backtracking
Hashing, Tries, and Bit Manipulation
Resources:
Practice on LeetCode, CodeForces, HackerRank, or CodeSignal.
Books: "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, "Elements of Programming Interviews" by Adnan Aziz.
Focus on time and space complexity analysis (Big O notation).
Competitive Programming Practice

Why: Helps to hone your problem-solving speed, efficiency, and adaptability to different problem types.
Where to practice: CodeForces, TopCoder, LeetCode Contest, and Kick Start.
What to focus on: Solve problems regularly, start with easy-medium, and gradually move to hard problems. Time yourself to improve problem-solving speed.
Priority 2: Web Development (Full Stack)
After you’ve got a good grasp of DSA, start learning web development. Full-stack knowledge will make you a versatile candidate.

Web Development: Front-End and Back-End
Front-End Development:

Languages & Frameworks:
HTML5 & CSS3: Basics of page structure, layouts, responsive design.
JavaScript: Master vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await).
React.js or Vue.js: Most popular JavaScript framework for building interactive UIs. Learn JSX, state management, and hooks.
CSS Frameworks: Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design and rapid UI development.
Version Control: Learn Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
Back-End Development:

Languages: Learn a back-end language like Node.js (JavaScript), Python (Flask/Django), Java (Spring Boot), or Ruby on Rails.
Databases:
SQL: Learn relational databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL), and basics of queries, joins, and transactions.
NoSQL: Learn basic concepts of NoSQL databases (MongoDB).
APIs: Learn how to build RESTful APIs, handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and work with JSON.
Authentication & Authorization: Basic concepts like JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, and sessions.
Deployment & DevOps:

Learn Deployment Basics: How to deploy apps on cloud platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Netlify.
Docker: Containerization for building, shipping, and running apps.
CI/CD Basics: Learn about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
Resources for Web Development:

Courses: The Complete Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele (Udemy), CS50’s Web Programming (Harvard/edX).
Build Projects: Build real-world projects like a personal blog, e-commerce site, or a chat application.
Priority 3: System Design (for Product-based Companies or Senior Roles)
Once you have a strong grasp of DSA and web development, shift focus to System Design, especially if you're targeting top product-based companies like Google, Amazon, or Microsoft.

System Design Fundamentals:

Key Concepts:
Load balancing, Sharding, Caching (Redis, Memcached)
CAP Theorem, Eventual Consistency
Microservices Architecture vs. Monolithic Architecture
Database design (SQL/NoSQL) and horizontal vs. vertical scaling
Fault tolerance, high availability, and disaster recovery
Queues and message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
Practice Designing Systems:

Start with basic designs like URL Shorteners, Social Media Platforms, or Online Shopping Systems.
Gradually move to more complex systems like Real-Time Chat Systems, Video Streaming Platforms, or Search Engines.
Resources for System Design:

Books: "System Design Interview" by Alex Xu, "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann.
Courses: Grokking the System Design Interview (Educative.io), System Design Primer (GitHub repo).
Mock System Design Interviews:

Practice system design interviews with peers or mentors to simulate real interview conditions. Platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io can help.
Priority 4: Soft Skills and Interview Preparation
While technical skills are paramount, soft skills are crucial for cracking interviews and excelling in placements.

Behavioral Interview Prep:

Prepare for Behavioral Questions (STAR technique: Situation, Task, Action, Result).
Have a solid understanding of your projects, internships, and experiences to showcase problem-solving, leadership, and teamwork skills.
Mock Interviews:

Participate in mock technical and behavioral interviews.
Platforms like Pramp, Interviewing.io, or mock interview groups at your college can be useful.
Resume Building:

Update your resume to reflect your projects, skills, and accomplishments.
Focus on impactful projects that demonstrate your problem-solving skills.
Priority 5: Advanced Topics (Optional)
If time permits or you want to target specific niches, learn advanced topics such as:
Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP)
AI/ML basics (if targeting roles in AI companies)
Mobile Development (React Native, Flutter)
Time Allocation (Suggested):
Months 1-3:

Focus on DSA (60% of time)
Start Web Development basics (40% of time)
Months 4-6:

Continue practicing DSA (40% of time)
Deep dive into Web Development (60% of time) – Full stack and building projects
Months 7-9:

Master System Design (60% of time)
Continue solving DSA problems (20% of time)
Practice mock interviews (20% of time)
Month 10+:

Final Revision on all topics, especially for interviews
Mock interviews, behavioral prep, and refine your resume
Conclusion:
This roadmap is designed to give you a clear focus on what to prioritize and when. By mastering DSA first, you’ll lay a strong foundation for your technical interviews. Once you’re comfortable with algorithms, dive into web development, followed by system design to prepare for more senior roles or top-tier companies. Lastly, don’t neglect soft skills and mock interviews, as they play a huge role in cracking the final interviews. Best of luck with your preparations!
