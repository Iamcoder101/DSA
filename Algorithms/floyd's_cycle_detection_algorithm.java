/*
The Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (also called the Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm) is a pointer-based algorithm primarily used for detecting cycles in a linked list, but it's often adapted to solve other problems, like finding the middle node.

‚úÖ Main Purpose of Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
‚û°Ô∏è Detect if a linked list contains a cycle (loop)
This is its original and main purpose.

üéØ How it works (Cycle Detection):
Two pointers:

slow moves 1 step at a time

fast moves 2 steps at a time

If there‚Äôs a cycle, fast will eventually "lap" and meet slow.

If there‚Äôs no cycle, fast will reach the end (null) safely.
*/

/*
Other Uses (Adaptations of the Idea)
The middle node trick is an application of the same two-pointer approach ‚Äî but not for cycle detection. Here's how it's repurposed:

Problem	How it uses the idea
‚úÖ Find middle of linked list   :	  When fast reaches the end, slow is at the middle
‚úÖ Detect start of the cycle    :   After detecting cycle, reset one pointer to head, move both one step each ‚Äî where they meet is the start of the cycle
‚úÖ Finding Kth element from end : 	Use fast pointer to go k steps ahead, then move both until fast reaches end
